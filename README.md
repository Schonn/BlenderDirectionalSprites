# BlenderDirectionalSprites
Concept Blender addon for rendering directional sprites in the Blender viewport Doom style

To use this sample, create a plane in blender and load in a 16 x 8 spritesheet image with tile size 300px ideally (sample sheet included)

No need to edit UVs, as long as the image dimensions are right, the script will make the needed updates to the uv map

Parent the plane to an empty and add any kind of custom property to the plane with the name 'VIEWSPRITECARD'

Click on 'Start Updating Directional Sprites' under 'Viewport Directional Sprites' in the 3d viewport righthand menu

Very early WIP, super enthusiastic for contributors if this might have usefulness somewhere!!
